			Projected a test in love, <br />
			And punished up, <br />
			I kept thinking of love, <br />
			Foully of mine, <br />
			That was undermined, <br />
			Threshed were you, <br />
			Barred were my sights, <br />
			2nd Feb. when I was there, <br />
			Was made to disappear, <br />
			What to say, <br />
			Foully was mine, <br />
			Projected a test in love, <br />
			Deep my heart cried, <br />
			What to do, was out of mine, <br />
			16th Feb. came with a light, <br />
			I wanted to have a delight, <br />
			Idea strikes my mind, <br />
			But, a week time remained unmodified, <br />
			To wait and think of reply. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
			Positive or negative, <br />
			Unknown, frightened, <br />
			I know that my exams are near, <br />
			Negative could make me fry, <br />
			And, boosted up I would be other way, <br />
			I damn, insecurity remain, <br />
			Does she love me? <br />
			What she thinks? <br />
			I fear of anti-mine, <br />
			Threesomes are they, <br />
			Closer the other way is one, <br />
			Fate of hidden double, <br />
			Or, is my fate to decide, <br />
			God please help me, <br />
			Please get some positive reply. <br />
			Crush, love or attraction, <br />
			It's not known, <br />
			But, please get me positive reply. <br />
			</p>
