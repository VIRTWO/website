	<p>Changes are mandatory and they have no escape! Though there cannot be any control over changes in terms of its coming into subsistence, the course can be diverted and that is what self has to fight and bother about.</p>

	<p>Silent moves and brisk observations followed by random behaviour are blanketing the novel or actual is coming out of evade, land self into dilemma. Cynic thoughts and sceptic judgments about the people who co-exist is awing upon the sanguine self. Sometimes it is bewildering and revolting that why the sight is not able to see the positive side of others? Well that is the transformation; save for what is the rationale of the change is more significant. The current scenario or the way of living or is it something else? All sense of logistics, thoughts, and perceptions lead the reckoning towards both. This reasoning sounds the least impressive of all due to the incongruous nature of the rationale provided. Then what is the motivation that has forced this crippling change, better say the characters of this change? Thoughts towards the origin of the above-mentioned justification make the picture clearer. It boils down to the people around, people whom self is listening, people whose thoughts intrude self's life, the most.</p>

	<p>With the source of transformation in front, streams of questions arise. If this change worth? Does it add anything good to self-life? Should self-change the nature of this vary? Has this transformation started to control the real self? All the queries lead to the lone answer; there is a need to change the course of the transformation and that is the sole thing that can lead to development of positive inner self.</p>

	<p>Identification and psychoanalysis of the source leave self with another question. How shall the self change the itinerary of the transmogrification happening in self's life? Shall the people or the person causing these be dropped out of self's life? Alternatively, is there any other way to achieve the same result? Will the path taken affect self's life? Is the rectification course capable of some other insane changes? This is the point of self being locked into dilemma. Narrowing everything down, from people to person, self arrives at glimpses of some near past, the person had been helpful, and was of some great assist in time when needed.</p>

	<p>Everything being clear, it is the time of decision, something bold, that may hurt and that may bring infamy. The person needs to be cut off from self's life, slowly, not physically but from thoughts. Self has to conclude all the individual relations and has to twirl the whole thing into a professional flow.</p>

	<p>It is easy to take a decision if the consequences are known. Worst of all, self realizes, realization of the person of cause, about the rectification step may lead to certain amount of professional loss, that may be more than certain amount, and perceptibly, personal disharmony. Well several risks are worth being taken and the self has to take this one. Self has to execute the decision and self knows that the self is strong enough to accomplish decisional thoughts.</p>

	<p>The quirk of fate is that these decisional thoughts are implemented the moment they are thought and so has this one. Probably self has found now one of the dishonourable adjusts that has crept into self's life and has successfully changed the course of the change.</p>
