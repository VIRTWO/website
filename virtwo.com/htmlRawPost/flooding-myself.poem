			I incept with riffraff, <br />
			To ace, among the bevy, <br />
			I thinned, <br />
			Though lesser, but ended well. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
				I was wrapped to one, <br />
				And got more than contentment, <br />
				Thanks! God, <br />
				For thy gift. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			Essence of mine, <br />
			Is more different, <br />
			Type I'm, <br />
			Is not to bash. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
				Extolling has ended, <br />
				Lying I'm to one, <br />
				Not even appraise, <br />
				I too confident. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			Though got les than my mark, <br />
			I even got impede, <br />
			But all that ended, <br />
			In hark I lost all. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
				Only operandi I was left with, <br />
				Give and take, <br />
				It was sole la modulus, <br />
				To escape those harsh. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			Temperance I don'tâ€˜ve, <br />
			But that never meant, <br />
			I lacked sobriety, <br />
			I made myself comply. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
				Enamored was not I, <br />
				Ended always-in infatuation, <br />
				But now I need a kiosk, <br />
				I am trite to change. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			Borstal is my aura, <br />
			I wish a run away, <br />
			But their no panorama, <br />
			That's left. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
				I've to be here and go on, <br />
				Struggling in my own, <br />
				To create some space, <br />
				To give myself air to breathe. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			Good grounding even, <br />
			Make me steam, <br />
			My nostalgia, <br />
			Doesn't find any deluge. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="poem-indent">
				I am back track, <br />
				With only difference, that came, <br />
				Earlier it was more of amateur interest, <br />
				And now my nostalgia. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			It's only way, <br />
			To make white blue, <br />
			And flood away my sensibility, <br />
			In vehement words. <br />
			</p>
