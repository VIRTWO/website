    <p>As such I have driven Fiat (with hand-gear), Ambassador, Wagon-R, and a SX4. All of them I drove mostly on highway and a bit in city with a total 500 or so Kilometre under my belt. So, in brief I am very new to driving and am on learning phase. I have driven my bike a lot clocking around 27500KM in last 1.5 years and have taken it to most of the Ghats and coasts around Bangalore. Well I am well informed about bike but with Car I am all about figures (specification) and looks.</p>

    <p>The bug of buying a car started around a year back after seeing one Safari from inside. I started dreaming about it day and night though was never able to contemplate how finances will be taken care of. Anyway, I kept reading posts on www.team-bhp.com regarding Safari and in meantime kept crunching miles on my Karizma.</p>

    <p>January 2011, the start of New Year, fired the thirst of buying Safari more. I was all set to buy it though I did not have money to pay the hefty down payment. I thought by loan and some savings the down payment will be managed. So, in February I started to take test-rides and since my Dad was always in favour of buying a hatchback as a first car, I decided that I will look into all the cars available below INR 1200000 on-road. My parameters while selecting the car were very clear. It has to be a Safari, a 4x4 Safari or it should be exclusive and should have good performance.</p>

    <p>The first car I test drove was HM Ambassador, due to nostalgic reasons. The sales person was nice but if only the car was nicer too. At a price tag of INT 700000 it was way too much for the features offered and the drive it gave. Anyway, the deal breaker was the top speed of 120KMPH (as per sales person). Heck, I drive my Karizma several times above 120KMPH and this car cannot even do that?</p>

    <p>Next I visited Mahindra showroom. I test-drove Logan and felt it to be very nice. I managed to touch 100KMPH very easily and did not even feel I was doing that. I calculated that will all the customizations it will cost me around INR 800000. Next I took Bolero for a ride. Man this SUV is a beast and is slow. It is difficult to drive and plastic parts are of very poor quality. Added to it was costing INR 800000 to with all customizations. Lastly, I drove Scorpio, and it was nice driving it. Though it was not as nice as Logan to drive, I felt in love with it.</p>

    <p>Checked finances, and realized I would be able to buy SLE version of the same. I took a look at Xylo also but did not find it of any use for me, though it was very nice to sit inside. With all this I must add my regards for the sales man at Mahindra who was very courteous and helpful.</p>

    <p>Now, it was time to visit Maruti. I was not at all inclined to buy any car from Maruti due to exclusivity factor but still I visited the showroom. 10 minutes and no one came to attend me then one lady came and handed me a leaflet with prices of all the cars and booking charges information, and left. I followed the footsteps of the lady, and left the showroom after collecting the leaflet.</p>
    <p>Next, I visited Hyundai showroom, to look at Accent. I never liked Santro, I10, and I20. The behaviour of sales people at Hyundai was in no way better than Maruti. With my Dad's advice in mind that do not buy a Accent, I left the showroom.</p>
    
	<p>At this point I must add that I like my Dad's knowledge about cars and driving. I still remember single stretch drives from Lucknow to Delhi or Azamgarh to Calcutta in few stops, or the tour of Nepal, or Tour of Central India, and so many more. With more than 30 years of driving experience and over 500000 KM under his belt, I regard his advices very highly. Initially he wanted me to buy a Hatchback under INR 800000 but seeing my interest in Safari he gave green signals for the same though suggested look at Scorpio owing to maintenance cost.</p>
    
	<p>Few months back while we were purchasing a car for my Dad (which eventually turned to be a SX4) we had taken test ride of City, Vento, Linea, Manza, Aveo, etc. With those test-rides I was clear that I did not want a Sedan.</p>
    
	<p>Well, now it was time to jump into Tata Showroom. I entered Prerna motors to be greeted by all people pushing me on buying a Manza or a Linea. Manza and Linea were ruled out being a sedan and the only sedan I considered was Etios (ruled out due to huge waiting period of 8-9 months).</p>
    
	<p>I made my point clear to Tata Sales man that I am not interested in Linea, Manza, Indica, etc. and I am here only for Safari. The guy asked to me to sit and wait. Then another guy arrived with a face as if I have spoilt his life by showing interest in Safari. He was not at all keen at showing me a Safari in flesh or even to provide a leaflet with details. I guess my face does not look like a to-be Safari owner. Anyway, I told him that I am interested in buying an EX 4x4. He thought for a second and informed me 4x4 is available only with VX variant. I told him that it's mentioned in website but he was like, Safari 4x4 never came in any variant other than VX. I got pissed off and left. At this point I turned all against Safari and was all set for Scorpio.</p>
    
	<p>Well in meantime I kept reading www.team-bhp.com and got interested in Polo and Ford Fiesta for the kind of performance they offer. Polo was ruled out as I did not like the looks of the car and in Lucknow while taking test-drive of Vento I did not like attitude of VW people. I know it may be foolish but I applied the same concept to Bangalore VW. Anyway, I gave a call to Ford and found sale person trying to convince me for a Figo (I don't like the shape of Figo). I was set to visit Ford anyway to get a feel of Fiesta but prospects of new Fiesta getting launched kept me off it.</p>
    
	<p>So, with all this I was now pin-pointed towards Scorpio but fate had something else for me. One day while returning home from office I saw Vinayaka Skoda (Sadashivnagar) and though of giving it a visit. I entered Skoda showroom, and was amazed by the welcome sales people gave to me (I have read only horror stories about Skoda so far). I took details of Laura and Superb (just for sake of taking it) and also Fabia. I asked them (and told that I won't be able to buys a Laura or Superb) to arrange for a test drive of Fabia petrol with 1.6L engine. 1.6L was not available so they arranged a 1.2L Fabia. I liked the quality of plastics and other stuff inside the car. I also realized that the sheet metal used in the body is far better than what is used in I10 or Swift (try pressing it). I took the test drive, felt it very smooth and kind of liked it.</p>
    
	<p>Now, since it had a 1.6L option which had brilliant specification, I fell in love with it. Scorpio was out now (mainly due to financial ease in buying a Fabia). I told the showroom folks that I will decide and come back after few days. They were very courteous and did not waste time selling stuff I did not want to me.</p>
    
	<p>I waited for 2-3 days, discussed with my Dad, calculated finances, read Fabia 1.6 reviews on www.team-bhp.com and consulted a few owners, and was back in showroom after 3 days. I paid INR 50000 for booking and was done with my decision in 10 minutes. Now, it boiled down to other problem i.e. how to arrange for rest of the money. I enquired about loans in Bangalore but then decided that it will be lot simpler to get it from Lucknow. I visited home in mid March and due to the good will of Dad (he is currently in fleet of doctors for CM) I got a loan from Vijaya bank in two days. I came back Bangalore with a draft of INR 760000 (20K for accessories and rest for Car, Road tax, Insurance, Extended Warranty, and Drive Assure).</p>
    
	<p>All the formalities were done at Skoda in minimal amount of time and in the most comfortable manner, and I was handed over the keys on March 31, 2011. I took most of the accessories they had to offer (Llumar sun films: 2K, Door sills: 4K, Rear speakers: 3.5K, Rear parking sensors: 3.5K and Car cover: 1.3K). Apart from that floor mats and mud flaps were thrown in for free. I knew that the accessories were costing me around 3K more than market price but somehow I took them. Other than that after reading so much about bad things done by Skoda, I was confused regarding my abilities to catch them if they do something wrong, so I put all trust on them. Even a PDI was not done. Anyway, I did the PDI and other checks afterwards and found all to be right.</p>
    
	<p>So this is how I landed up being a Skoda Fabia owner. All i wanted from my car was exclusivity and performance and Fabia has it. It is not very common on Bangalore roads and it can do speeds more than my bike comfortably. To top it, it is as fast as SX4 we own.</p>
