    <p>Travelling has always been fun for me provided I did not have to walk, especially alone. I used to travel mostly by bus or train, an intelligent choice indeed, saves money and one gets to see a number of faces. Travelling means to see new places for timid people but I attribute it to seeing buses and trains, experiencing the phenomenon experience one gets while travelling in them.</p>
    
	<p>Over the years, I learned that travelling in buses was more interesting than travelling in train. On a long route, boarding a bus never means that one has lost the option to change the bus on route. One can always get down, board another bus, travel as long as one wishes and make the journey as one likes. Trains on contrary do not provide the same options.</p>
    
	<p>Travelling is as I said earlier is loads of entertainment, but one has to satisfy a certain number of requirements. These requirements include the following.</p>

	<p><ul>
	
		<li>One should not be over-critical.</li>

		<li>One should not be very emotional and sentimental.</li>
		
		<li>Beauties and amusements should not influence one easily.</li>
		
		<li>One should be ready to get going.</li>

	</ul></p>
	
	<p>With all these behavioral requirements in my bag, I was a good traveler. I used to travel to both near and distant places, preferably in bus. I used to break the journey into smaller parts, with each path travelled by a different bus. It is so amusing that you change your bus and move into the other without the earlier bus complaining. Another advantage comes from the fact that the investment in bus-travel is insignificant. One may feel that the time wasted while changing bus is a disadvantage but it turns up into a benefit by providing time to relax and plan about the next bus one wishes to travel. Ride experience is also usually good, owing to the preplanning, but it is also true that sometimes the ride becomes bumpy.</p>

	<p>Well travelling by bus gets all the praises but one has to appreciate the smooth ride that trains offer, the only disadvantage being in the fact that the travel-cost is a bit higher and one has to be in the same train for much longer time period. Anyway, I have seen a number of men preferring to travel by train. I cannot hide the fact that travelling by airways is fun too. Actually, travelling by airways has most amount fun, if compared to trains and buses, but on much more higher cost, one has to shell out many notes for the same.</p>

	<p>Anyways, I was happy the way I was travelling. I travelled in a variety of buses. I experienced the bumpy ride of the local bus, smoothness of the Volvo and mediocre Deluxe Coaches. Express services got my attraction too but I never was able to gather enough strength to board them. Over the period, I travelled in red, blue, green, yellow, and even rainbow colored buses. I tried various state road services too. I travelled in Rajasthan Roadways, Uttar Pradesh Roadways, Andhra Road Services, Karnataka Buses, and possibly travelled all the services I could get hands on.</p>

	<p>One thing that still puzzles me is I was never able to get myself attached with any of the buses I travelled. Probably I was scared of something or the buses are supposes to be not attached with. People get their hand on the engine, driving, ticketing and all geeky stuff if the bus driver allows, but I never got into any of these. I was always scared and always felt something stopping me from doing the same. I guess it all owes to the unsafe nature of buses and the tasks, which stopped me.</p>

	<p>Well lots about buses, trains would have started feeling bad by now. I wished to travel by a number of trains but the authorities always dumped me on one or other grounds. Some said I was not intelligent enough and some said I did not have enough money. Trains, which were cheap enough and in the ones I was eligible, were always booked, I never even got the reservation. These all things never made the tourist in me down, I kept trying but at last lost hope when even after getting reservation I was not able to get into the train. The doors of the coach were jammed. Anyway, the door opened but the train had started moving by then, I could not take the risk of climbing on the running train.</p>

	<p>I had started losing my interest in travelling itself when a beautiful bus crossed my way. I could not stop myself and grabbed a seat. I never knew at the time of boarding that this bus was with burst Dunlop. It was hardly one stop when my stomach started to grunt and I decided to board off. I did what I felt but the bus not like every time else, turned back, did hit me (almost killed me), damaged own parts, and went off. That was the end of my bus travel but humans are destined to travel, the mode is all that changes, new experiences were waiting for me.</p>

	<p>In the days I travelled a lot, I saw many men travelling by cars. Mind it personal cars and not taxies. Taxi is something very similar to a bus. I also wished travelling by the cars but never had enough money to purchase one. Actually, I never liked any of the cars available to me. I also got lucky enough to get offers from various companies to take two-wheelers free or on premiums. I appreciate those companies and appreciate the two-wheelers who tried to provide me with mode of travel, when I had none, but I somehow never even tried to ride a two-wheeler.</p>

	<p>Several months passed without travel and I grew accustomed of walking so much that I never even got thoughts of travelling by bus or train. Wise men say that nothing is permanent and the same turned true for me too. One day a beautiful car passed in front of me, a bright red sports car with a touch of classics. I always wanted to ride the same kind of car. Well, that car has actually crossed in front of me earlier also but I never paid attention to it, I was busy with my train-travel. I even never realized that it was the same car when I had to travel to hospital by the same after the bus I traveled last did hit me. Men always do such mistakes and I am another one from the herd.</p>

	<p>I knew what I had to do. I could feel some unknown force attracting me towards the car of my dream. I started saving money. I started being learned to get make the dream car my own. Greed has lots of power and it can change a person completely but it was not greed. I wanted the car to be mine with the way I was and I am.</p>

	<p>I started being with the car authority and the shine of the car started to become my mission and my life. I had gathered some money by then and have started to feel that the car authority will not deny me taking the car. Strange but the car authority was car itself. I told the authority that I would take it from them one day. Authority resisted but allowed me to take a ride in the car and one day the car was mine. My labor turned into fruits.</p>

	<p>I cannot share the divine experience of mine with the beautiful car in words and I can also not let you ride it even once, such has my passion and possessiveness about the car grown. Still to satisfy the curious onlookers I would add here few things about the precious car. The car is extremely beautiful and it seems God was pursuing some sort of hobby, while on vacation, that he got much of time to design the marvel. Whether it is, the exterior or the interior, everything is just perfect for me. The sportiness, the speed, the controls, the thrill and the brakes that it offers while traveling is the best fit for me. During food breaks on long routes, the car offers the best of possible luxury, stay, warmth, music, and everything one could wish for during travel. Security is another feature that comes in. Infinite number of locks holding the steering and doors are just inaccessible to all but me. The rear-view mirror shows more than from the front, every plan of travel seems clear, projected in front of my eyes. The car has hints of classics, which have only appeared after long relation between the car and me. These classics are equally refreshing. In all this is the car I always dreamt about, and this is the best car for a person like me.</p>

	<p>I have travelled long distance from this car by now and the entire ride has been smooth, apart from some bumpy rides owing to the bad roads. People often ask me, when I am going to change the car? Alternatively, when do I plan to start riding buses and trains again? Even the two-wheeler companies have not left poking back their nose but always to vain, I do not even open the doors for them anymore. The bond between my car and me has grown so strong over the period that I have got it registered on my name several times by now. I love my car and I know from the state of the engine and body of the car that my car loves me too. It is never troublesome.</p>

	<p>As far as the future is concerned, I do not think about it anymore. I am happy with my eternal car and I am always going to be its pride owner. I cannot even think of riding any other car now, none of the other cars have the appeal my car has. I do not even remember when I fantasized of another car last. I do not even like seeing posters of videos of other cars, not even talks.</p>

	<p>I also love the fact that my car has a very intelligent computer installed in it. It can run on auto-drive mode when I feel sleepy, warns me when I leave the door open, complains when I do not clean her, make tea when I wish for, runs on the best mileage possible, has the doctor facility when I am sick, is remote controlled, can change colors and has all the modern equipments installed on-board.</p>

	<p>This car has created a few enemies for me too. I hate people who try to steal an eye on my car or desire to own it. Many people even try to talk to car directly but they are probably unaware that somebody can drill a hole in their brain one day if the limits are crossed. I cannot tolerate any kind of sharing of my car, even if someone wants to have it in his or her own thoughts.</p>

	<p>To end with my story of travel I could only wish that everyone had the best car for them until and unless it is my car itself. I know a personal car has its maintenance cost but the travel becomes splendid when it is one’s own, the personal dream car but mind it owning a car has its own requirements to be fulfilled, which includes the following.</p>

	<p><ul>
	
		<li>One has to take good care of the car.</li>
		
		<li>One cannot leave the car in course of travel.</li>
		
		<li>One has to be sensitive and emotional.</li>
		
		<li>One has to respect the car.</li>
		
		<li>One has to have a high determination.</li>
		
		<li>One has to travel in the same car throughout life.</li>
	
	</p></ul>

	<p>I hope one understands the value of the own car as soon as possible in life and even gets it if they do not plan to take my car.</p>

	<p>Happy travelling!</p>
