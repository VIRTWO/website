	<p>"Sucks! And yes it sucks! Working, researching, training and everything you do in a government organization suck." Guess that's why people want to run away from these organizations. The thing that's foggy is why I see a long line of candidates seeking government jobs, everyday in front of government offices. I don't agree if you say it's the unemployment that actually makes them come here; I believe it's only the work that's offered. Yeah! It's awesome.</p>

	<p>Let me throw some light on the work routine of a normal government servant. It will reflect the ease of work, flexibility offered and pleasant atmosphere you get when you are a government servant. (Hey! I won't call it 'government servant' anymore, I don't like these words. Let's do some C programming and say '#define ANT government servant.)</p>

	<p>Daily a ANT arrives at 9:00 AM IST sharp, to his office and ANT very well knows what IST means. Now, ANT checks his emails, chats, browses internet and does everything to take full use of the technology. Whoosh! So much work done, it's not easy to keep your ass on the stupid chair staring at the idiotically behaving box for long. So, he goes into hibernation for an hour or so and relaxes inside the AC chamber, rocking his well cushioned chair. Then starts the major part of ANT's routine. ANT has to Gossip! Talk! Explain! Brainstorm! On topics ranging from Indian security, internal politics, sports, movies, degradation of culture to the last evening spent with hot/sweet female/male co-employee. Hmmn! I guess that would have ended the list of topics if I would have told that such sessions end with, discussion on family problems and cursing the government. Well, by the time this all routine takes place its 12:30PM, Lunch Time! And obviously as you would have already guessed, ANT leaves for lunch. Who won't feel hungry after this much of hard work? After ANT comes back from lunch its relaxation time. You know that how sleepy it feels when you enter your calm AC office after a superb but subsided lunch and hence the government obviously provides ANT with relaxation in rules so that ANT can relax. Then it becomes 3:00PM, Tea time and ANT wakes up has tea and is all set to go and do work. Then for whole one hour you have to work in a situation much similar to hell. You have to do lots of paper work, give reports, submit excuses, draw salary, and file medical compensations, plan your evening, think about your loans and all the hell sort of work in the world. Tough time! Huh! But happy time comes after sour time only and it becomes 4:30PM. And, as the time to leave for home is 5:00PM ANT has to prepare for that and finally he leaves at 5:00PM IST sharp. I can't understand one thing here that why the definition of IST defers in morning and evening.</p>

	<p>Well what do you say now, compare your pissing job with the job of ANT and you will never say that you are at an advantageous position. I have heard from some of my friends that private companies are not at all patriotic, they will force you to come at 9:0AM UST (United States Standard time) sharp and you can't leave before 5:00PM UST. And, that's not the end if you don't work or aren't able to finish your project by deadline they will throw you out. How cool is life of ANT's, they can kill their spouse, mother etc or can make them ill a number of times in the same week and the senior ANT will happily accept the reason for failure of deadline. And to add more you have fixed salary if you are in a private company, just see the benefit a ANT reaps under the table and obviously ANT doesn't needs to pay any tax for it. Well enough said about benefit of being a ANT as the list will go on and on.</p>

	<p>The only thing I don't understand after reaching this far is why some ANT tend to act like a private company employee in government companies and tend to make life of other ANT's miserable.</p>

	<p>Whatever I am happy doing my internship in a government company but being influenced by this rock culture even I am going to leave all these benefits as soon as the internship ends and join some private company. God save me!</p>
