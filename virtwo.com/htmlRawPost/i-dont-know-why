	<p>I don't know what's happening to me, I don't know why I am changing. I don't remember if I was like this before, probably I was and that was hidden. God! Why I have started searching for shanti, which probably should be the last business of someone of my age? I don't have any answers. 2? years down the lane I was a person who gave a damn about the world and it's true, if the time could be decremented. I was a person who never expected anything out of anyone, no returns at all but I feel everything's getting changed. A man who loved to walk his journey alone is feeling tired. I am feeling changed and I am feeling restless. I neither thought of doing well to others nor did I do anything bad, I just enjoyed myself. Though I was very social I had my spaces were I could feel the world in me. Still, it's same but these spaces seem to offer no more peace, probably I had exhausted that all.</p>

	<p>The biggest problem I am facing now is attachment created by myself and as a result the expectations I start doing because of it. I don't know if I am wrong, but I do wish now that if I care about someone above my time, resources and all, I should beget it back. Probably, now I have lost the ability to judge people and I get stuck with people for whom priorities are different and people who think different, and I guess that's what I have to do now. Again, I don't know if I was wrong, but I had given importance to my friends, family & relations more than myself. I never remembered, but now it's in front of me, I had been solving questions before my board's exam but the questions were not related to academics, but problems with somebody's life and it caused me to loose more than 3% marks directly, because I fought with my teacher for somebody else. College life! I don't know with how many people I have spoken about myself, even with some of my very good friends, but have spent hours listening to them, their problems, be it be my exam the next day or I was myself stuck with some problem. Everyone has problems and even my friends had, but why do I sense it every time? Why can't someone else do the job? Why can't someone else sense when I have problems? And, yes I have sensed the problem with myself, I overreact! Why the hell I should call someone for hours just because I know that person would need someone to talk after some act, say exam when I myself would have spoiled mine. Why the hell I feel bad if someone is sick? Why in the world I feel bad when some people don't have a smile on their face? And, why I am standing there to help? These were some of my mistakes and I will change myself and that's what needs to be done. I have to now make career and money more important then others and that's what most of the others care about. When I know this way is easier for me I have to follow it now but at the same time I will have to pretend I am there for everyone, because this is what I feel most of the others do. I don't understand now why I should help someone when that â€˜someone' won't be there when I would be in need of help. I will have to stop thinking about doing things that may bring smile on others face but will have to concentrate on things that make me smile most. Most important of all I will have to stop attaching myself to anyone, and that's probably the biggest mistake I do, and worst of all I repeat my mistakes. Anyway whatever is the case this time I am going to change myself and I know my determination.</p>

	<p>God knows what I have written but paper and pen is your only friend when you have decided to walk alone. And, you can't share, because that's what weakens you most. I am lucky when I was down to worst today, people with whom I have probably been talking most were not there to talk, God thanks for this. The best part was more than quarter of my day has passed for others today also, and at the end I was in talk with some friend of mine from Pakistan, a Muslim girl talking with whom, not even sharing, helped me most, she is one of them from whom I never expect anything and belongs to a country I hate most. Whatever I am happy now.</p>
