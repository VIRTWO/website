	<p>Wikipedia, on date, defines Crush as a short-lived, intense and usually unrequited love, sexual attraction, or infatuation and infatuation is defined as the state of being completely carried away by unreasoning passion or love. Well most of the people who have studied romantic love, call crush or infatuation as the early stage of the love. Well I am not going to do another study of Romantic Love or the involved stages right now, though will love to do sometime in the classical light. Here, I am just answering another common question asked, every now and then, whether be it birthday parties, start of a new relation, leg pulling or whatever. The question in various forms, says the same i.e. "Enumerate your crushes from certain point of time of your life?"</p>

	<p>This piece, answers the above mentioned question. The 'point of time' is assumed to be grade ninth. The period before ninth grade is assumed to be one spanand periods after ninth grade have been divided smaller chunks for uniform distribution. Well, obviously this piece involves names, and many will not like their name appearing over here. In case you are the one whose name appears here and you quite don't like it, please do inform me about the same, and I will be glad to remove your name. As a final word, I shall not be held responsible for any loss caused to you by this piece, and if you do so, please read the next line.</p>

	<p><i>Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.</i></p>

	<p>Well, I guess the stage is set to proceed towards the major of this piece now. Let me answer the question, mentioned in the beginning, in the light of the discussion held till this point. I will start with the longest spanof time i.e. before Ninth Grade.</p>

	<p><ul>
	
		<li>Umme Habiba: Loved the name. I couldn't have loved anything else I was in grade fourth that time.</li>

		<li>Sneha Agarwal: She could sing the song 'Chori Chori' so beautifully that I just could not resist liking her.</li>

		<li>Swati Agarwal: She was the topper of our batch, or at least was among the top students. Looked pretty and I always wondered how can someone be academically so strong.</li>

		<li>Ridhima Alagh: Was very fascinated by the story between her and Manu Srivastava. That was probably the first story I ever heard in the context. As such I even liked her name.</li>

		<li>Richa Raghuwanshi: Again was fascinated by the name. 'Raghuwanshi' sounds so cool.</li>

		<li>Renu Rathore: I admire her mental toughness and composure and to add icing, she was brilliant in academics.</li>
	
	</ul></p>

	<p>In grade ninth, tenth, and eleventh I was completely absorbed into study and my own life so never got much time to think of anything else. I cannot recall if I had any major or minor crushes during that period. All I can recall are a few names which I have listed below.</p>

	<p><ul>
	
		<li>Ankita Diwedi: I do not know if the name is right or wrong, anyway for sure it will be partially right. I guess she used to live in our campus and was probably the most composed and beautiful girl in existence that time. I remember me and my friends used to watch her while playing, and discussed lot about her.</li>

		<li>Megha Tiwari: She was one of the prettiest girls living in our school campus, mind it was a boy's school, and you do not get to see lots of girl in there.</li>

	</ul></p>
	
	<p>Twelfth grade! This was the time I fell into a serious crush for the first time. The name of the girl was, actually, is still Meenal Gupta. I met this girl in some science quiz, liked the cherubic nature and fell for it. This was one of my longest crush and continued till first semester of my college.</p>

	<p>Till the end of second year of the college, I again did not have any crushes, though I admired a number of faces. I do not quite well remember the names now and neither do I remember the faces but yes they were numerous. Most of the faces I still remember are of seniors and I do not know how to pen down the face. One among the seniors was a girl who used to smoke at Sky, C'not, (Places in my college campus) etc- She was not my crush (she carried herself in more horrible way than I do carry myself) but her smoking did fascinate me a lot. I recall name of one of the seniors, Shrankhala Upadhyaya, she was a master piece. I do not recall the names but some of the girls in her circle were cool too.</p>

	<p>Thirds year, and I fell into hands of another crush. The name of the girl is Namita Negi. She is cute, simple, brainy, cherubic, and angelic. This was my last serious crush, as on this date, and is one of the longest one I ever had. I met her, fall for her, and proposed her (I proposed her via Email and that was so dumb.) and she said no and then a full stop. The good thing is that we are still talking and this is another good quality of her that separates her from other girls, she is clear in what she says (most of the time) and probably does not hooks to old things.</p>

	<p>After finishing my first degree, I rejoined the college to earn another degree (I am still pursuing it), without which I cannot officially say that I am into computers. During this all, since my second year, another love, mind it not crushes was maturing and that was love for computers, grew to its maximum. After I rejoined the college, I did not have many thoughts that differed from the thoughts about computers so did not fall in any serious crush again other than a small one month relation but that was not crush.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I have added another name Aditi Jha to this list, as I told to her after seeing one of her snaps and as per her, I will delete the name after seeing her in evening (Huh! Who does it after posting?). Anyway, I was just kidding, she is a good buddy and will crush me if I have crush over her.</p>

	<p>So, that is all. Next time I am ever asked the question about my crushes, I am going to divert the askers here and if somehow you have read this all, please don't ask me the same question again. Another thing, do put up a list of your crushes too, who knows, you find your name, in someone's list, whose name appears in your list.</p>

	<p>That is it! Bye for now, see you again.</p>
