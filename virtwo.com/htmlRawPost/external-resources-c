	<p>C Programming language is one of the oldest programming languages that is still in wide use and hence becomes one with most of the resources available. Next is given a list of resources that would be helpful in C programming.</p>
	
	<p><b>Compiler</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC - GNU</a>: This is a opensource compiler and would be the best if you want start learning C or are interested in developing application for linux or the linux itself.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mingw.org/">MINGW</a>: If you do not like working on Linux, then MINGW will provide you with a simple import of GCC on Windows and would satisfy most of your learning needs.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Library</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/index.html">GNU C Library</a>: This will provide you with a complete reference of C and its library and obviously it is applicable best on GCC.</li>
	</ul>	

	<p><b>Standards</b></p>	
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.html">Open-std</a>: This will provide you with a reference of the current C programing language standard. If you are an advanced programmer, this may be of interest to you.</li>
	</ul>
		
		
	<p><b>Books</b></p>	
	<ul>
		<li>"C Unleashed", Richard Heathfield, Lawrence Kirby, Ian Woods, and Steve Summit</li>
		<li>"C Programming Language", Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie</li>
	</ul>
