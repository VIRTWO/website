    <p>Two days back I met a college junior, probably a third year student of Civil Engineering, by chance, and during the course of some ebullient talks he told that the blogs related to BITS - Goa episode (related to some scuffle between students and the Chief Warden) have been banned. I told him that banning of blogs containing material that hamper the image of BITS should not be written by the students themselves.</p>

    <p>I believed that somebody should not write material or do communication of any sort that tarnishes the image of the institution in anyway, at least not in a manner accessible by external world. I strongly felt that the time spent on writing such material could be better utilized in providing feedback to the institution for corrective measures.</p>

    <p>The above notion is in one or other manner followed by many people, and many of them belong to administration. They take care that students do not do communication, derogatory to BITS. This is a step that is most helpful for the students. I do not believe that any enterprise will hire a person from a college having a bad image, and this only one of the examples of the kind. Tarnished image of the institution will affect all the current students and even the alumni.</p>

    <p>Somehow the beliefs changed today, not due to some incident but from a few thoughts. Above actions are just the limits that I had built around. I was thinking all in terms of what is good for me or any other student but the picture is lot bigger. The day I wanted to join BITS - Pilani, I had just one image of BITS i.e. BITS is one of the top ranked college of India and is supposed to be all good, good in all respects.</p>

    <p>The image that was built in my mind was very exuberant. I did my schooling from one of the well known schools of India and have seen some of the finest teachers. I expected that the teachers in BITS would be among the best. I expected teachers who know all and who knew all about motivating students, teachers with the finest educational background, and teachers better than the teachers I have seen in school. I imagined BITS to have laboratories of the kind Dexter has.</p>

    <p>I thought that surviving between students who have ranked highest in their secondary examinations would be a nightmare (I joined through school quota holding 88% marks and at that time BITS had merit based admissions with cutoffs usually higher than 95%). I and my group at school were highly absorbed academically. We used to talk a lot about future working on random experiments in laboratories and life. I expected an academic environment better than I had seen.</p>

    <p>The day I joined BITS, I had thought that the day I will leave BITS, I would be holding a job of 40-50K per month in hand. I thought everything would be not just fine but best. I was highly influenced by the fact that ragging is actually banned in BITS. I was very happy reading the reviews about BITS on Internet and in magazines (BITS was ranked in top 5 in 2003).</p>

    <p>Well if the kind of blogs or communication that goes public today, if would have reached me then, I would have probably skipped the admission. If I had known BITS the way I know it today, I would have probably not joined BITS. When I became sure about my admission in BITS I just stopped trying. I know I had the potential to get into other colleges as well with some hard-work. Somehow the scenario was different, I knew for sure that I would score enough to get a seat in BITS and just did not work at all. I remember giving RPMT after having beer, giving AIIMS examination in midst of party preparation, and I remember I left the Mathematics paper untouched in AIEEE (I know I am not good at mathematic but I did not try even), I gave probably all the examinations in fun since I had an easy way in front of me leading to one of the top most institutions satisfying all the dream expectations.</p>

    <p>I did three mistakes in regard. I never in person inquired about BITS, I chose the easy option, and I relied on information from magazines. This though makes the picture about communication larger for me.</p>

    <p>Why would I have not chosen the easy option? Why would I have thought about any college when the top most college was in front of me? Why would I have given a second thought to my actions, when BITS was full filling all my expectations? I know I would have not done something in this regards.</p>

    <p>Well I did one grave mistake that I did not enquire about BITS in person. Well if I would have tried, how would I have done it? I would have visited the campus, seen infrastructure here and then would have probably said, "It is an old building with a brand name and is not at all a matter of concern." I would have seen the library (old library in between FD-II and FD-III) and then would have wondered about its size. I would have attended a class and would have appreciated the knowledge of some professor, since I would have not understood lot of part of the lecture. I would have seen some laboratories and would have wondered about the number of laboratories BITS has. Believe me all this information would have been misleading.</p>

    <p>What probably I should have done is talking to seniors, the then students of BITS and here comes the crunch. Most of them would have praised BITS, building the brand value. If someone would have been talking differently, probably would have not said anything clear due to the fear of administration.</p>

    <p>I am puzzled now about the picture we consider. Brand value of BITS is important for me and for all other who are in any way part of the institution but is the picture just this large? If BITS has a good image then good companies will come for placements, good teachers will join BITS, and intellect students will join BITS. In the way companies will get some of the best students, students will get some good brand attached to them, and teachers will have some of the brightest students to teach. This all in turn will increase the reputation of BITS higher, making it a recursive process.</p>

    <p>Well the last argument means that my beliefs about the communication were right but then the question is why does then such communication happen? The answer is that the recursive process projects a wrong image of the institute. The picture is actually lot bigger. People land up into institute with wrong images and somehow people who land up here are the best brains. If they would have been in some other place, probably their potential would have been tapped in a better way. IIT and BITS may be good but may not be best for everyone.</p>

    <p>When someone joins BITS and does not likes something, talks about it to peers, learns that feedbacks do not work, compromises on the situation. In summary, the projected image attracts brain from all over the country, and gets many brains that have the higher potential or have capability to be best in some other environment.</p>

    <p>I have seen over years that many students changed their career after some years. Some became NGOS, some entered into business, and some turned into writers. I have even seen people who into actors and people who took up civil services. The best that I saw was that a student from my batch (2003) left BITS in his third year and took some multimedia related course. There exist only two reasons for this. One is that they had this so called inner calling and some just at some point of their life though it as a better opportunity.</p>

    <p>What leads to these reasons? The primary one is parents and school peers. School peers who say are interested by engineering keep telling about its benefits and do affect our though process in one way or other. Parents keep in touch with the world and when they read about the institutes like BITS frame an image that this is the best option for their child. All these affect the self-proclaimed wise student in framing illusionary images, and here the picture expands.</p>

    <p>A bright student does bright in most of the scenarios. When such students give examinations of colleges like BITS with the illusionary image, they are certain to get an admission. These students later find themselves in a situation that's impossible to escape. They leave with it and keep on making decisions on base of the same. Later they find themselves unsatisfied professionally (look at the number of unsatisfied IT persons) and doing things just because they have to do it, without interest. In turn another student who would have loved the scenario misses the admission and lands up into some place of not his interest. This expands the picture lot more.</p>

    <p>Imagine a company full of brightest people doing all their assigned work but not with interest. The company thence may show growth but suffers when these people get the so called inner calling and leave. To make the situation worse, though all the assigned work is done, creativity is lost, and changes do not happen in time leading to some other company gaining over. On the other hand imagine a company where everyone is all interested in the work they do, may sometime take time to o the routine job, but keep using their creativity to generate new solutions. The later companies are who survive all the times and cause radical changes. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and similar people loved their work. They selected places that met their expectations. They were able to do so because they knew about those places and the situations they offer. They rejected places that did not fit well into their expectations.</p>

    <p>Rejecting a place after landing up into the place is often difficult, at least in cases when institutions like BITS are concerned. So, what I understood was let people know what the real scenario is inside. Tell them what the truth is, and tell them what lies hidden. I do not know how many students will actually be interested in pursuing a M.E. - Software Systems at BITS if they have other options and know the inside condition.</p>

    <p>If communicating these truths is something derogatory or tarnishes the image of the institution, let them do that. If the college has to do well let it improve the bad conditions. If someone writes a blog that teachers here are not good, then it is in all sense good. If someone feels that the food is not good then let the thought be visible to the world. If all mixed up unverified good facts are presented then why the bad should not be presented. This may cause problems but in long run will help in improvements only, and if improvements do not happen, let the sufferings be incurred.</p>

    <p>Creating the illusions is more like playing with future, which could be better. Banning the blogs as happened in BITS - Goa is not the solution, the solution is in improvement. Administration if spends more time solving the cause of these miscommunication then trying to catch communicator, will help the institution in larger way and will help the overall growth of everyone.</p>
