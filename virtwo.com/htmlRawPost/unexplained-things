	<p>I always believed in"these things" but never found words to express them and so am I stuck today. I know outwardly I may appear to be very frolicsome, careless and easy going but when confided to myself I am a different person, far more serious and a brooder. I know I am drifting away from "these things", but the stage has to be set, since my image, does in no way fits in the stuff I am going to type about, as far as I know. I know I may always be found joking or just doing nonsense things but what's bad in doing something foolish if it can bring a smile on others face. So, in brief whatever I am going to type in here is purely based on practical experiences which may not be enough strong to prove but will surely point towards "these things" and are not just a creation of idle mind.</p>

	<p>Well these things exist and don't have many names and even if they have we are reluctant to believe in their existence. Yes, I am talking about all the supernatural, metaphysical and all other nonsense stuff which deep inside we believe do exist but are never ready to accept. Here, I have jotted down few of my real life experiences from my BITSIAN life.</p>

	<p>Well to start with I'll start with the most recent one. Yesterday I was fiddling with date of birth of mine and few others. In the way I was working with date of birth of Namita Negi one of my good friends, for something that's in no way related to this text, moreover since this may be read by her I'll mould the words into other cast. Well I found one very interesting result out of some of my calculations that was scheduled to happen today. I didn't consider it seriously since the calculations were done roughly. I won't be telling the deduction since I don't even wish to work on that, but instead will tell you what the calculations said. It was very clearly reflected in the calculations that she would be emotional or upset today due to unknown reasons and it did happen. Though it may appear to be a very small thing but the time span of actualization holds value in my sight, since the calculations were kept simple and were done in some other respect but it did reflect some of the parts that were going to be true in very near future, so if were carried in the regard I am talking about, could have showed some more interesting results. Well this is the first pointer towards "these things" and the pointer that made me write about this all.</p>

	<p>Secondly, I'll like to quote an incident from my first year. I remember it was winter time and clock said the time was around 2:00AM. I arrived to my room, had a fag, jumped into the bed, pulled the quilt when I heard dog cry. The very first thing that came into mind was someone is going to dye. It's believed that dogs cry in a specific way when someone's going to dye and the person who understands it has a death in house. I was in hostel so though who's going to dye here, tests themselves don't give time to breathe, what's more left to dye. But it turned out true, morning around 3-4 a second yearite died of frets. He lived in our hostel only and had a guy sleeping in his room to take care of him. Sadly, that day only that guy was not sleeping with him. The second night I had guesses, that I'll surely here crow shout near my hostel, and it turned up true too. Let me tell those who are seeing current BITS, that time crows population didn't cover the trees on the road in front of Gandhi-Krishna Bhawan. I knew it did point about existence of "these things" but who wants to believe.</p>

	<p>From my faint memory I can recall again an incident from my second year. One of my friend Yash walks to me one night somewhere around 8:00PM, a day before some test and says he 'feeling something's wrong, he can't concentrate and after some gossip we decide to go to library and study there. In library again he didn't feel comfortable and we go to IPC and then movie but to no use. We finally decided to have a long walk in the campus and then go to Saraswati temple and then to Shiv-Ganga. It is an incident; let me add to your knowledge, after 2-3 days of suicide of Golden Dragons wife. We walked on from the road in front of Vidyapeeth talking about girls, doing all those goofy talks, which a guy of our age does enjoys wasting his time. We entered the temple crossed the stairs and suddenly we find the topic of our discussion has changed from girls to experiences of ours, about brutal deaths, accidents and murders which we have seen or at least were sure about. We were in shock; you can yourself see what the difference in state of mind is between these too talks. We decided to go to Shiv-Ganga and see if some ghost is there, to add to another failure of ours in this field. I do also sensed something's bad there, but was not at all able to anticipate it, but the change of topic of talk and all other things of surrounding that happened did make me think. Yes, I had found another pointer, though not strong but for a person like me, it again does hold value.</p>

	<p>These three were a few of my light experiences about "these things" but there exists other too which I don't have enough words to cast into, like a trip to some 'Havelies' at around 2:00AM during BOSOM last semester, my visit to Shiva Temple at my home during last winter holidays, interpretation of some of the dreams, my visit to Balaji Temple near Agara, many astrological happenings, Vyas House incidents in my school, some incidents my Mom & Dad did experience and many more to add but probably the list will never end. If you wish to know more, contact me, I have a bag full of experiences to share.</p>

	<p>Well in brief, all what I wanted to point towards was, there does exists something's which are beyond our control, imaginations, arguments and everything that we know, but are neglected and though most of us might have experienced but never ever want to accept. Well, one last thing, I am not at all saying ghosts exist or so does soul and all those stuff, but all I have to say is something's exists and they are the only explanation to many of the things.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I would like to express my sincere sorry to people whose names I have typed or the people attached to any of the incidents mentioned. I know if the person mentioned in the first incident reads it, will for sure get some queries and so may others, but please don't take this blog otherwise or in any sense that's negative, its all that I have experienced, and kindly do not ask any, any personal questions regarding any incidents.</p>

	<p>Bye for now, my junior has said to limit words while writing any blog, so winding up, Good Bye! See you back with my next blog.</p>
