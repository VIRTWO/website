	<p>Insanity is hidden and is hidden in all in various forms. Sometimes it's visible and sometimes people are able to hide it from the eyes of others. The story is same for all, at one or other abstraction level, and this leaves a question boggling our mind, that why people with open forms of insanity are criticized? Do they do something wrong? Shall they change?</p>

	<p>The quest to satisfy our questions leads us to exploration of human behavioural insanity to a greater depth. The most criticized form of insanity is the one above the abstraction level of visibility. The non-figurative reasons for the condemn of the visible insanity takes the form of the reasons that sound like being hurt by the practitioners of perceptible insanity in various forms. Lack of words also gives rise to reasons of wilful nature of the visible insanity practitioners. Lastly, if nothing sounds acceptable ply of intrusion in individual life is sought as a motivation of denigration. Diverse rationales are still available for criticizing the named psychosis followers but more or less they are same at one other level of abstraction.</p>

	<p>Brooding on these lines, mind drives towards finding the rationalization of the reasons of vilification of the insanity practitioners. Justification depends all upon the extremity of the measures and also on the individual who faces them. Some people may like the imposition and several may become apprehensive in the same condition and it all again in turn depends upon the personal vigour of the individual. Looking as of a higher abstraction one cannot distinguish if is it a corner of insanity practitioner or the individual. The psyche always forces our conduct to support the individual facing the actions. With the upper hand, when the person who has faced the exploit, if falls amongst the bevy, who are in accord, forgets about the good deeds of the visible insanity practitioners and falls in the hands of eternal bliss of criticism. Experience has always taught on the contrary that if the situations are changed, mob of people in accord against visible insanity practitioner are removed, the individual who faces the events gets an entirely different perception, but situations are few. Human temperament, ordinarily, is doomed to find ecstasy in criticism and runs towards mass holding like opinions and that is the heart of the problem.</p>

	<p>Next question that needs to be answered is, are the practitioners of insanity in visible form of abstraction, ideally wrong? Looking from the perception of general thong, they are very wrong. None likes to be subjugated, intruded or face parallel actions, whether it is in the real world or ideal world. On contrary the hidden fact is who does not want to subjugate, intrude or prove oneself superior. Denial of this contrasting fact subjected only to the limitation of acceptance of the reality, but fair enough, there may possibly be exceptions and these exceptions are people who have crossed the human behavioural pensiveness echelon. Observing the scenario from external liberty reflects the verity that both the kinds of insanity practitioners are identical fundamentally. Here the rationalization is all decided by the counts of both sides. Numeric values do play important role in the real world.</p>

	<p>Before the finishing line is touched, the question left unanswered is, should the visible insanity practitioners change, if the count of differing nature crosses their count? Supremely the answer is a straight rebuff. Visible insanity practitioners should seek the companionship of like individuals; if at all a blissful existence is desired. The mentioned course of blissful life is the rule of the human race. Violation of this rule is not very uncommon and often the visible insanity practitioners stand against the law of majority. The real criticism at a higher level of abstraction remains all about the popular beliefs and mass. If changes are not acceptable to the insanity practitioners, then the lone selection they are left with is to stand firm and struggle against, but then there remains no room for complains and this is the central point of collapse. Finally, the decision about adopting the majority's outlook remains in hands of the minors.</p>

	<p>Answering all the questions and satisfying the desire, we arrive at the destination but as one of the great poets said, "A man's destiny is not his destination," we set towards a new journey, with the new questions, which have crept into the mind, into another voyage with unknown destiny.</p>
