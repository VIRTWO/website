		When I bought this domain I wanted to start a company and name it Virtwo. Well, I never started the company but kept the domain. In case you are 
		wondering Virtwo stands for Virtual World. I then decided to use this domain to host my blogs and articles but could never let go off the idea to not
		start the company. So, I ended up building two websites blog.virtwo.com and learn.virtwo.com and left <a href="index.html">www.virtwo.com</a> as a page under construction.
		Overtime I started taking my photography seriously and needed a place to host the website and that led to <a target="_blank" href="http://photo.virtwo.com">photo.virtwo.com</a>.

		In meantime I stopped writing blogs and articles. They were never for me to start with but the websites continued. I kept migrating them from one technology to other, from Dotclear to Joomla
		and then to Drupal. Played around for few years with Drupal and settled on it only to be annoyed by security updates, spam comments and version migrations. This was even more annoying 
		as I was not writing any content. So, I decided to do one final migration. I deleted the Drupal installation and wrote this website template (using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>). That led to another pain, how to import any past posts? I looked at couple of static website generators and they either did way too much or did nothing. So, I ended up writing a simple 
		static website generator and generated this website (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VIRTWO/website/tree/master">download</a>).
